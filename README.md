# binary-deterministic-state-machine-builder
JavaFX application. Binary deterministic state machine builder and representer.

This application is developing as university coursework for Theoretical Informatics subject. <br>
Represents configurator for binary deterministic state machine builder with alphabet contains only '0' and '1' symbols. <br>
It is possible to enter input string contains alphavet symbols and special control characters. <br>
When entering a new symbol, the change in the state of the machine will be graphically visible. <br>

<h3>Alphabet</h3> 
[ '0' , '1' ]

<h3>Control symbols</h3>
'u' - (undo) return machine to the previous state <br>
'c' - (clear) clear input string and return machine to the start state <br>
'q' - (quit) shutdown of the machine <br>
