JavaFX application. Deterministic state machine builder and representer.

This application is developing as university coursework for Theoretical Informatics subject. <br>
Represents configurator for deterministic state machine builder with alphabet with predefined symbols. <br>
It is possible to enter input string contains alphavet symbols and special control characters. <br>
